    The aim of a diabetic retinopathy classification project is to develop a computer vision system that can accurately classify diabetic retinopathy in retinal images. Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes that can lead to vision loss and blindness if not detected and treated early.

The project aims to use machine learning algorithms to analyze retinal images and identify signs of diabetic retinopathy such as microaneurysms, hemorrhages, and exudates. By accurately classifying the level of diabetic retinopathy in an image, the system can help clinicians prioritize patients for treatment and monitor disease progression over time.

The ultimate goal of a diabetic retinopathy classification project is to improve the quality of care for patients with diabetes by providing a more efficient and accurate method of screening for diabetic retinopathy, which can ultimately prevent vision loss and blindness.
